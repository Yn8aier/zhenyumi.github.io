<p>The average adult human synthesizes ATP at a rate of nearly <u>10<sup>21</sup> molecules per second</u>, equivalent to producing his or her <u>own weight in ATP every day</u>.</p>
<p>Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle by themselves generate relatively little ATP directly.</p>
<p>However, <u>under aerobic conditions, six dehydrogenation steps</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One in glycolysis</li>
<li>One in pyruvate dehydrogenase</li>
<li>Four in the citric acid cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively reduce <u>10 moles</u> of NAD+ to <u>NADH</u> and <u>2 moles</u> of FAD to FADH2 per mole of glucose.</p>
<p><u>Reoxidation of these reduced electron carriers in the process termed cellular respiration generates most of the energy needed for ATP synthesis.</u></p>
<p>Oxidation of <u>1 mole of NADH (FADH2)</u> by the respiratory chain provides sufficient energy for synthesis of <u>~2.5 (~ 1.5)</u> moles of ATP from ADP.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200307202658016.png" alt="image-20200307202658016" style="zoom: 20%;" /></p>
<p>In eukaryotic cells <u>NADH and FADH2 are reoxidized by electron transport proteins</u> bound to the <u>inner mitochondrial membrane.</u></p>
<p>A series of linked <u>oxidation and reduction</u> reactions occurs, with <u>electrons</u> being passed along <u>a series of electron carriers</u>—<strong>the electron transport chain</strong>.</p>
<p>The final step is reduction of <u>O<sub>2</sub> to water</u>.</p>
<p>The overall electron transport sequence is quite <u>exergonic</u>.</p>
<p><u>One pair of reducing equivalents</u>, generated from 1 mole of <strong>NADH</strong>, suffices to drive the synthesis of between <u>2 and 3 moles of ATP</u> from ADP and by a process termed <strong>oxidative phosphorylation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>(32 x 30.5)/2870 = 34% under standard conditions</u></p></li>
<li><p><u>ATP hydrolysis is worth 50-60 kJ/mol in vivo, 60-70%</u></p></li>

<p>Overview of oxidative phosphorylation:</p>
<p><u>Reduced electron carriers</u>, produced by cytosolic dehydrogenases and mitochondrial oxidative pathways, become reoxidized by enzyme complexes bound in the inner membrane.</p>
<p>These complexes actively <u>pump protons outward</u>, creating an energy gradient whose discharge through <u>complex V</u> drives ATP synthesis.</p>

<p>Embedded within the <u>inner membrane</u> are the protein carriers that constitute the respiratory chain.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Complex I and complex II</strong> receive electrons from the oxidation of NADH and succinate, respectively, and pass them along to a lipid-soluble electron carrier, <strong>coenzyme Q</strong>, which moves freely in the membrane.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complex III</strong> catalyzes the transfer of electrons from the reduced form of coenzyme Q to cytochrome c, a protein electron carrier that is also mobile within the intermembrane space (IMS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complex IV</strong> catalyzes the oxidation of cytochrome c, reducing O2 to water.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The energy released by these exergonic reactions creates a <u><strong>proton gradient</strong> across the inner membrane, with protons being pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space.</u></p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Protons then re-enter the matrix through a specific channel in <strong>complex V</strong>.</li>

<p>It is convenient to think of respiratory control as a dependence of respiration on <u>ADP as a substrate for phosphorylation.</u></p>

<h1 id="七oxygen-as-a-substrate-for-other-metabolic-reactions">七、Oxygen as a Substrate for Other Metabolic Reactions</h1>
<p>The term <strong>oxidase</strong>（氧化酶） is applied to enzymes that <u>catalyze the oxidation of a substrate without incorporation of oxygen from O2 into the product.</u></p>
<p>A <u>two-electron oxidation</u> is usually involved, so the <u>oxygen is converted to H2O2.</u></p>
<p>Most oxidases utilize either a <u>metal or a flavin coenzyme.</u></p>
<p><u>D-Amino acid oxidases</u>, for example, use FAD as a cofactor.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>&gt; 90% O<sub>2</sub></u> is used by oxidative phosphorylation</p></li>
<li><p><u>&lt; 10% O2</u> by other metabolic reactions</p></li>
<li><p>200 enzymes use O2 as substrate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>O2 is rather unreactive, so need metal ion or other cofactors</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Oxygenases</strong> (加氧酶) are enzymes that <u>incorporate oxygen atoms from O2 into the oxidized products</u>; there are <u>two classes</u>—<strong>monooxygenases</strong> (单加氧酶) and <strong>dioxygenases</strong> (双加氧酶).</p>
<p><strong>Dioxygenases</strong>, which incorporate <u>both atoms</u> of O2 into one substrate, are of limited distribution.</p>
<p>An example is tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which contains a heme cofactor and catalyzes the first reaction in tryptophan catabolism:</p>
<figure>
<img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200308122519109.png" alt="image-20200308122519109" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">image-20200308122519109</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr />
<p><u>Far more widely distributed</u> are <strong>monooxygenases</strong> (单加氧酶), which <u>incorporate one atom from O2 into a product and reduce the other atom to water.</u></p>
<p>A <strong>monooxygenase</strong> has <strong>one substrate (AH)</strong> that accepts oxygen and <strong>another (BH2)</strong> that furnishes the two H atoms that reduce the other oxygen to water.</p>
<p>Because <u>two substrates are oxidized</u>, enzymes of this class are also called mixed-function oxidases (混合功能氧化酶).</p>
<p>The general reaction catalyzed by monooxygenases is as follows:</p>
<figure>
<img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200308122624044.png" alt="image-20200308122624044" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">image-20200308122624044</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Because the substrate <u>AH usually becomes hydroxylated</u> by this class of enzymes, the term <strong>hydroxylase</strong> (羟化酶) is also used.</p>
<p>An example of this type of reaction is the <u>hydroxylation of steroids</u>. Here the reductive cofactor, <u>NADPH, appears as BH<sub>2</sub>.</u></p>

<p><u>Cytochromes P450 are involved in hydroxylating</u> a large variety of compounds.</p>
<p>These reactions include the <u>hydroxylations in steroid hormone biosynthesis</u> and the synthesis of <u>hydroxylated fatty acids</u> and <u>fatty acid epoxides</u> (环氧化合物).</p>
<p>In addition, cytochromes P450 act upon thousands of <strong>xenobiotics</strong> (外源化合物).</p>
<p><u>Hydroxylation of foreign substances</u> usually increases their <u>solubility</u> and is an important step in their <u>detoxification</u>, or <u>metabolism and excretion</u>.</p>
<p>However, some of these reactions result in <u>activation of potentially carcinogenic substances to more reactive species</u>, as shown for <strong>aflatoxin (黄曲霉毒素) B1</strong> which is converted to more reactive species either by hydroxylation or epoxidation.</p>

<h3 id="hydroxyl-radical">1. Hydroxyl Radical</h3>
<p><u>Hydroxyl radical is the most active mutagen derived from ionizing radiation.</u></p>
<p>Hydroxyl radical is also produced from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the Fenton reaction:</p>
<figure>
<img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200308123324021.png" alt="image-20200308123324021" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">image-20200308123324021</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="superoxide">2. Superoxide</h3>
<p><u>Superoxide per se is relatively nontoxic.</u></p>
<p>Because it contains an <u>unpaired electron</u>, it is a free radical, and it combines readily with another free radical, <strong>nitric oxide (NO, 信号分子，促进血管扩张)</strong>, a biological signaling agent that is produced in many animal tissues.</p>
<p>The product is <strong>peroxynitrite</strong> also considered a reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrite causes <u>lipid peroxidation</u> and also causes <u>nitration of tyrosyl hydroxyl groups</u> in proteins, a reaction particularly damaging to membrane proteins.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200308123345159.png" alt="image-20200308123345159" style="zoom: 33%;" /></p>
<p><strong>Hydroxyl radical</strong> also damages <u>nucleic acids</u>, both by causing polynucleotide strand <u>breakage</u> (double-stranded DNA breaks are lethal) and by changing the structure of DNA bases.</p>
<p>About 20 different base changes, or <u>DNA lesions</u>, are known to result from reactions of hydroxyl radical with DNA.</p>
<p>Some lesions are mutagenic because the altered base created, such as <strong>8-oxoguanine</strong> (8-氧鸟嘌呤), <u>forms non-Watson–Crick base pairs during DNA replication.</u> (Cause DNA mutation)</p>
<p>Other lesions, such as <strong>thymine glycol</strong> (胸腺嘧啶二醇), are potentially lethal because, unless the lesion is repaired their occurrence in DNA <u>blocks replication</u> past that site.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200308123709531.png" alt="image-20200308123709531" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>
<p><u>Uncontrolled overproduction of reactive oxygen species</u> has the potential to inflict considerable <u>damage</u> on the tissues in which they are produced, a situation called <strong>oxidative stress</strong>.</p>
<p>A series of elaborate mechanisms has evolved to minimize its harmful consequences.</p>
<p>The <u>nonenzymatic protection</u> is afforded by <strong>antioxidant compounds</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Glutathione 谷胱甘肽</li>
<li>Vitamins C and E</li>
<li>Uric acid 尿酸</li>
</ul>
<p>These compounds can <u>scavenge ROS</u> before they can cause damage, or they can prevent oxidative damage from spreading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blueberry reduces ROS</li>
<li>Smoking increases ROS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disease">Disease</h2>
<p>Among <u>enzymatic mechanisms</u> the first line of defense is <strong>superoxide dismutase (SOD, 超氧化物歧化酶)</strong>, a family of metalloenzymes that catalyze a <u>dismutation</u> (<u>a reaction in which two identical substrate molecules have different fates).</u></p>
<p>Here, <u>one molecule of superoxide is oxidized to H2O2 and one is reduced to O2.</u></p>
<p><strong>Hydrogen peroxide</strong> (过氧化氢) is metabolized either by <strong>peroxiredoxins</strong> (过氧化还原酶), a ubiquitous family of thiol proteins, <strong>catalase</strong> (过氧化氢酶), another widely distributed enzyme, or by a more limited family of <strong>peroxidases</strong> (过氧化物酶).</p>

<p>In pyruvate oxidation, the acceptor of the <strong>active aldehyde (hydroxyethyl group, 羟乙基)</strong> generated by TPP is lipoic acid, which is the internal disulfide of <strong>6,8-dithiooctanoic acid</strong>. (6,8-二硫代辛酸)</p>
<p>The coenzyme is joined to via an <u>amide</u> bond linking the carboxyl group of lipoic acid to a lysine -amino group. Thus, the reactive species is an amide, called <strong>lipoamide (硫辛酰胺)</strong>, or <strong>lipoyllysine</strong>.</p>
<p><u>Each lipoyllysine side chain</u> is ~14Å long, and is located within a flexible lipoyl domain of E<sub>2</sub> (and E<sub>3</sub>BP), allowing it to function as a “<u>swinging arm (摆臂)</u>” that can interact with the active sites of both the <u>E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>3</sub></u> components of the PDH complex.</p>

<p>The cyclic disulfide of lipoamide can undergo a reversible two-electron reduction to form the dithiol, <strong>dihydrolipoamide (二硫醇，二氢硫辛酸)</strong>.</p>

<p>Because the thiazole ring is weakly acidic (pKa ~ 18 for the ring hydrogen), a general base is required in its ionization.</p>
<p>As shown in the following diagram, a glutamate carboxyl group in the enzyme deprotonates N-1 of the pyrimidine, which in turn increases the basicity of the amino group, facilitating the deprotonation of C-2 of the thiazole ring to give a dipolar thiazolium carbanion (or ylid).</p>

<p>To be used for gluconeogenesis, <strong>oxaloacetate（草酰乙酸）</strong> <u>must move out of the mitochondrion to the cytosol, where the remainder of the pathway occurs.</u></p>
<p>However, the mitochondrial membrane does not have an effective transporter for oxaloacetate.</p>
<p>Therefore, oxaloacetate is reduced by <u>mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase to</u> <strong>malate（苹果酸）</strong>, which is transported into the <u>cytosol</u> by exchange for orthophosphate and then reoxidized by <strong>cytosolic malate dehydrogenase（苹果酸脱氢酶）</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>pentose phosphate pathway（戊糖磷酸途径）</strong> <u>converts glucose to various other sugars</u>, which can be used for <u>energy</u>.</p>
<p>Its most important products, however, are <strong>NADPH</strong> and <strong>ribose-5-phosphate (R5P，5-磷酸核酮糖)</strong>. R5P是合成DNA，RNA的部件分子。</p>
<p>In stage 1, the <u>oxidative phase</u>, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to <u>ribulose-5-phosphate</u> and CO2, with production of NADPH.</p>
<p>The remaining stages constitute the <u>nonoxidative phase</u> of the pathway.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Biochemistry%20II%20%28Metabolism%29/image-20200218214153449.png" alt="image-20200218214153449" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>

<p>The pentose phosphate pathway has <u>different modes of operation</u> to meet varying metabolic needs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When the primary need is for <u>nucleotide biosynthesis</u>, the primary product is ribose-5-phosphate. Reducing equivalents from NADPH are used to reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotide.</li>
<li>When the primary need is for <u>reducing power (NADPH)</u>, fructose phosphates are reconverted to glucose-6-phosphate for reoxidation in the oxidative phase.</li>
<li>When only moderate quantities of pentose phosphates and NADPH are needed, the pathway can also be used to <u>supply energy</u>, with the reaction products being oxidized through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.</li>

<h2 id="different-kinds-of-organisms">Different Kinds of Organisms</h2>
<h3 id="two-major-categories">1. Two Major Categories</h3>
<p>Metabolism can be subdivided into two major categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Catabolism</strong>（分解代谢） - those processes in which complex substances are degraded to simpler molecules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anabolism</strong> （合成代谢）- those processes concerned primarily with the synthesis of complex organic molecules.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Catabolism is generally accompanied by the net release of chemical energy.</p>
<p>Anabolism requires a net input of chemical energy.</p>
<p>These two sets of reactions are coupled together by ATP.</p>
<h3 id="source-of-the-fuel-molecules">2. Source of The Fuel Molecules</h3>
<p>A fundamental distinction among organisms lies in the <u>source of their fuel molecules</u>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Autotrophs（自养生物）</strong> (from Greek, “self-feeding”) synthesize glucose and all of their other organic compounds from inorganic carbon, supplied as CO2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heterotrophs（异养生物）</strong> (“feeding on others”) can synthesize their organic metabolites only from other organic compounds, which they must therefore consume.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A primary difference between plants and animals is that <u>plants</u> are autotrophs and <u>animals</u> are heterotrophs.</p>
<h3 id="need-of-oxygen">3. Need of Oxygen</h3>
<p>Microorganisms show adaptability (适应性) with respect to their ability to survive in the absence of oxygen.</p>
<p>Virtually all multicellular organisms and many bacteria are strictly <strong>aerobic（需氧的，有氧的）</strong> organisms; they depend absolutely upon <u>respiration</u>, the coupling of energy generation to the oxidation of nutrients by oxygen.</p>
<p>By contrast, many <u>microorganisms</u> either can, or must, grow in <strong>anaerobic（无氧;厌氧菌的）</strong> environments, deriving their metabolic energy from processes that do not involve molecular oxygen.</p>
<h2 id="three-stages">Three Stages</h2>
<p>Both catabolic and anabolic pathways occur in three stages of complexity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stage 1: the <u>interconversion</u> of polymers and complex lipids with monomeric intermediates</li>
<li>Stage 2: the <u>interconversion</u> of monomeric sugars, amino acids, and lipids with still simpler organic compounds</li>
<li>Stage 3: the ultimate <u>degradation to, or synthesis from</u>, inorganic compounds, including CO2, H2O and NH3.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="brief-overview-of-metabolism">Brief Overview of Metabolism</h2>
<p>A brief overview of metabolism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall also use the terms <strong>intermediary metabolism</strong>, <strong>energy metabolism</strong>, and <strong>central pathways</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Intermediary metabolism (中间代谢)</strong> comprises all reactions concerned with</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>storing and generating metabolic energy and</li>
<li>with using that energy in biosynthesis of low-molecular-weight compounds (intermediates) and</li>
<li>energy storage compounds.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><u>Not included</u> are nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis from monomeric precursors. The reactions of intermediary metabolism can be thought of as those that do not involve a nucleic acid template because the information needed to specify each reaction is provided within the structure of the enzyme catalyzing that reaction</li>
<li>可以将中间代谢的反应视为不涉及核酸模板的反应，因为在催化该反应的酶结构中提供了指定每种反应所需的信息。 可以将中间代谢的反应视为不涉及核酸模板的反应，因为在催化该反应的酶结构中提供了指定每种反应所需的信息。</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy metabolism (能量代谢)</strong> is that part of intermediary metabolism consisting of pathways that store or generate metabolic energy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Central pathways of metabolism (代谢的中心途径)</strong> are substantially the same in many different organisms,</p>
<ul>
<li>and they account for relatively large amounts of mass transfer and energy generation within a cell; they are the quantitatively major pathways</li>
<li>The central pathways involve the oxidation of fuel molecules and the synthesis of small biomolecules from the resulting fragments; these pathways are found in all aerobic organisms</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Intermediary metabolism（中间代谢）</strong> refers primarily to the biosynthesis, utilization, and degradation of <u>low-molecular-weight compound</u> (intermediates).</p>

<h1 id="二freeways-on-the-metabolic-road-map">二、Freeways on the Metabolic Road Map</h1>
<p>The first pathway that we study is <u>glycolysis（糖酵解）</u>, <u>a stage 2 pathway</u> for degradation of carbohydrates, in <u>either aerobic or anaerobic cells</u>.</p>
<p>The major input to glycolysis is glucose, usually derived from either energy-storage polysaccharides or dietary carbohydrates.</p>
<p>This pathway leads to <strong>pyruvate（丙酮酸）</strong>, a three-carbon α-keto acid.</p>
<p><u>Anaerobic</u> organisms reduce pyruvate to a variety of products, for example <strong>lactate（乳酸）</strong>, or <strong>ethanol</strong> plus carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>These processes are called <u>fermentations</u>.</p>
<p>In <u>oxidative metabolism</u> (respiration), the major fate of pyruvate is its oxidation to a metabolically <u>activated</u> two-carbon fragment, <strong>acetyl-CoA</strong>.</p>

<p>The two carbons in the <u>acetyl group</u> then undergo oxidation in the <strong>citric acid cycle</strong>.</p>
<p>In aerobic organisms the citric acid cycle is the principal <u>stage 3 pathway.</u></p>
<p>This cyclic pathway accepts simple carbon compounds, derived not only from <u>carbohydrate</u> but also from <u>lipid or protein</u>, and oxidizes them to CO2.</p>
<p>Using the freeway analogy again, we will see that numerous on-ramps（引导滑道） from the highways and byways of stage 1 and stage 2 metabolism lead to the citric acid cycle. In fact, all catabolic pathways <u>converge</u> at this point.</p>

<h3 id="distinct-pathways-for-biosynthesis-and-degradation">(+) 5. Distinct Pathways for Biosynthesis and Degradation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to realize that in these cases the opposed pathways are quite distinct from one another</p>
<p>They may share some common intermediates or enzymatic reactions, but they are separate reaction sequences, regulated by distinct mechanisms and with different enzymes catalyzeing their regulated reactions. They may even occur in separate cellular compartments</p>
<p>Biosynthetic and degradative pathways are never simple reversals of on another, even though they often begin and end with the same metabolites</p>
<p>Thus, opposed biosynthetic and degradative pathways must <strong>both be exergonic</strong>, and thus unidirectional, in their respective directions.</p>
<p>Using separate pathways for the biosynthetic and degradative processes is crucial for control, <strong>so</strong> conditions that activate one pathway tend to inhibit the opposed pathway and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="futile-cycle">Futile Cycle</h2>
<p>Degradative and biosynthetic pathways are distinct for two reasons:</p>
<p>A pathway can be exergonic in only one direction</p>
<p>Pathways must be <u>separately regulated</u> to avoid <strong>futile cycles（无效循环）</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>futile cycle</strong>: No useful work is done</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Compartmentation and allosteric control</u> of anabolic and catabolic processes prevent futile cycles, which simply waste energy.</p>

<p>A similar futile cycle could result from the interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate with fructose-1,6- bisphosphate in carbohydrate metabolism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, enzymes catalyzing both of the above reactions respond to allosteric effectors, such that one enzyme is inhibited by conditions that activate the other. This <strong>reciprocal control (相互控制)</strong> prevents the futile cycle from occurring, even though the two enzymes occupy the same cell compartment.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is more appropriate to call this situation—two seemingly opposed cellular reactions that are independently controlled— a <strong>substrate cycle</strong>. (底物循环)</p>
<p>底物循环（substrate cycle）。一对催化两个途径的中间代谢物之间循环的方向相反、代谢上不可逆的反应。有时该循环通过ATP的水解导致热能的释放。例如，葡萄糖+ATP=葡萄糖-6-磷酸+ADP与葡萄糖-6-磷酸+H2O=葡萄糖+Pi反应组成的循环反应，其净反应实际上是ATP+H2O=ADP+Pi。</p>

<p>Reactions 12.2 and 12.3 are examples of <strong>obligate-coupling stoichiometry</strong>. These are stoichiometric relationships fixed by the chemical nature of the process.

<blockquote>
<p>The transfer of electrons from these intermediate electron carriers to oxygen is catalyzed by the <strong>electron transport chain</strong>, or <strong>respiratory chain</strong>, and oxygen is called the <strong>terminal electron acceptor</strong>.</p>

<p>Note, however, that calling a substance a high-energy compound does not mean that it is chemically unstable or unusually reactive</p>

<p>It is more accurate to say that ATP has a “high phosphoryl group transfer potential” than to call it a high-energy compound</p>
<p>The electrostatic repulsion among the negative charges in the molecule before hydrolysis, resonance stabilization of the products of hydrolysis, and the tendency of the hydrolysis products to deprotonate</p>

<p>This is mainly because intracellular concentrations are far different from the 1M concentrations used to compute standard free energies.</p>

\]</span> For a given enzyme, the flux control coefficient is the relative increase in flux, divided by the relative increase in enzyme activity that brought about that flux increase.</p>
<p>For a true rate-limiting enzyme, the flux control coefficient is 1; a 20% increase in the activity of that enzyme would increase that flux rate by 20%.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flux-control coefficients are properties of the pathway or metabolic system, and thus all the flux-control coefficients in the pathway must sum to 1: <span class="math display">\[
C_{1}^{J} + C_{2}^{J} + C_{3}^{J} + ··· + C_{n}^{J} = 1
\]</span> The predictions of metabolic control theory can be tested, for example, by using mutations affecting a specific enzyme to bring about defined changes in the activity of that enzyme in vivo</p>
<p><em>every</em> enzyme in a pathway contributes toward control of that pathway; in other words, every enzyme has a flux-control coefficient greater than zero.</p>
<p>Thus, regulation of a pathway is <em>distributed</em> among all of the enzymes involved in the pathway, giving rise to the concept of <strong>distributive control of metabolism</strong>.</p>

<p>By <u>inactivating individual enzymes, mutations and enzyme inhibitors</u> help identify the metabolic roles of enzymes.</p>
<p>The steps of a hypothetical metabolic pathway are identified by analysis of mutants defective in individual steps of the pathway.</p>
<p>We can identify metabolite C as the substrate for enzyme III by the absence of this enzyme in mutants that accumulate C.</p>
<p>We know that D and E follow C in the pathway because feeding either D or E to mutants defective in enzyme III bypasses the genetic block and allows the cells to grow.</p>
<h1 id="七radioisotopes-and-the-liquid-scintillation-counter">七、Radioisotopes and the Liquid Scintillation Counter</h1>
<p>Radioisotopes <u>revolutionized</u> biochemistry when they became available to investigators shortly after World War II.</p>
<p>Radioisotopes extend by orders of magnitude the <u>sensitivity</u> with which chemical species can be detected.</p>
<p>Traditional chemical analysis can detect and quantify molecules in the <u>micromole or nanomole range</u> (i.e., 10-6 to 10-9 mole).</p>
<p>A compound that is “labeled,” containing one or more atoms of a radioisotope, can be detected in <u>picomole or even femtomole amounts</u> (i.e., 10-12 to 10-15 mole).</p>
<p>Radiolabeled compounds are called <strong>tracers</strong> because they allow an investigator to follow specific chemical or biochemical transformations in the presence of a huge excess of nonradioactive material.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://20190531-1259353497.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/image-20200212172934650.png" alt="image-20200212172934650" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>
<p>Of the many uses of <u>stable isotopes</u> in biochemical research, we mention three applications here.</p>
<p>First, incorporation of a stable isotope often increases the <u>density</u> of a material because the rare isotopes usually have higher atomic weights than their more abundant counterparts.</p>
<ul>
<li>This difference presents a way to <u>separate</u> labeled from nonlabeled compounds physically, as in the Meselson–Stahl experiment on <u>DNA replication</u>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, compounds labeled with stable isotopes, particularly are widely used in <u>NMR</u> studies of molecular structure and dynamics.</p>
<p>Third, stable isotopes are used to <u>study reaction mechanisms</u>. The “kinetic isotope effect” refers to the effect on reaction rate of substitution of an atom by a heavy isotope.</p>
<h1 id="八metabolomics">八、Metabolomics</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Metabolomics is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites. Specifically, metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles.</p>
<p>（代谢物组学（英语：metabolomics）是在后基因组学时代兴起的一门跨领域学科，其主要目标是定量的研究生命体对外界刺激、病理生理变化、以及本身基因突变而产生的其体内代谢物水平的多元动态反应。）</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The development of these new technologies has driven the “-omics” revolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genomics</li>
<li>Transcriptomics</li>
<li>Proteomics</li>
<li>Metabolomics</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Hundreds or even thousands</u> of specific components are measured simultaneously in a biological sample.</p>
<p>Thus, it is now feasible to measure the <u>full set of transcripts (<strong>transcriptome 转录组</strong>)</u>, proteins (<strong>proteome（蛋白质组）</strong>), or metabolites (<strong>metabolome（代谢组）</strong>) in a particular cell or tissue.</p>
<p>The metabolome represents the <u>ultimate molecular phenotype</u> of a cell under a given set of conditions because all the changes in gene expression and enzyme activity eventually lead to changes in cellular metabolite levels (<u>the metabolic state or profile</u>).</p>
<h2 id="basic-process">Basic Process</h2>
<p>Basic process of metabolic profiling:</p>
<p>Metabolites are identified and quantified by an analytical method.</p>
<p>Data are collected and visualized by informatics approaches.</p>
<p>Informatics approaches are then used to reveal relationships and patterns among the samples.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><u>Reception of the signals depends on receptor proteins, usually (but not always) at the cell surface, which bind the signal molecule</u>.</p>
<p>The binding activates the receptor, which in turn activates one or more <strong>intracellular signaling pathways</strong> or <strong>systems</strong>. These systems depend on <strong>intracellular signaling proteins</strong>, which process the signal inside the receiving cell and distribute it to the appropriate intracellular targets.</p>
<p>The targets that lie at the end of signaling pathways are generally called <strong>effector proteins</strong>, which are <u>altered in some way</u> by the incoming signal and <u>implement the appropriate change in cell behavior</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the <strong>signal</strong> and the <strong>type</strong> and state of the receiving cell, these effectors can be <strong>transcription regulators</strong>, <strong>ion channels</strong>, <strong>components of a metabolic pathway</strong>, or parts of the cytoskeleton</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In most cases, however, signaling cells secrete signal molecules into the <strong>extracellular fluid</strong>. Often, the secreted molecules are <strong>local mediators</strong>, which <u>act only on cells in the local environment of the signaling cell.</u> This is called <strong>paracrine（旁分泌） signaling</strong> (Figure 15–2B). Usually, the signaling and target cells in paracrine signaling are of <u>different cell types</u>, but cells may also produce signals that they themselves respond to: this is referred to as <strong>autocrine（自分泌） signaling.</strong></p>
<p>A quite different strategy for signaling over long distances makes use of <strong>endocrine cells</strong>, which secrete their signal molecules, called <strong>hormones</strong>, into the <u>bloodstream</u>. The blood carries the molecules <u>far and wide</u>, allowing them to act on target cells that may lie anywhere in the body</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="diverse-receptors">3. Diverse receptors</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Many signal molecules act at very <u>low concentrations</u> (typically ≤ 10<sup>–8</sup> M), and their receptors usually bind them with high affinity (dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub> ≤ 10<sup>–8</sup> M; see Figure 3–44).</p>
<p>In most cases, receptors are <strong>transmembrane proteins</strong> on the target-cell surface</p>
<p>In other cases, the receptor proteins are <strong>inside the target cell</strong>, and the signal molecule has to <u>enter the cell to bind to them</u>: this requires that the signal molecule be sufficiently <u>small and hydrophobic</u> to diffuse across the target cell's plasma membrane</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Cell Is Programmed to Respond to Specific Combinations of Extracellular Signals</p>
<ul>
<li>Many cells, for example, require a specific combination of extracellular survival factors to allow the cell to continue living; when deprived of these signals, the cell activates a suicide program and kills itself—usually by <strong>apoptosis</strong>, a form of <strong>programmed cell death</strong></li>
<li><strong>differentiation</strong> into a nondividing state (called <strong>terminal differentiation</strong>) frequently requires a different combination of <strong>survival and differentiation signals</strong> that must override any signal to divide.</li>
</ul>
<p>A signal molecule often has different effects on different types of target cells</p>
<ul>
<li>The different effects of acetylcholine (乙酰胆碱) in these cell types result from differences in the <strong>intracellular signaling proteins</strong>, <strong>effector proteins</strong>, and <u>genes that are activated</u>. Thus, an extracellular signal itself has little information content; it simply induces the cell to respond according to its <u>predetermined state</u>, which depends on the cell's <u>developmental history</u> and the <u>specific genes it expresses</u>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>receptor protein, not a signal molecule, provides a response</p>
<p>Most of signals are proteins which are larger or not hydrophobic and cannot go through the membrane.</p>
<ul>
<li>They bind to membrane receptors activating <strong>intracellular signaling molecules.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Two types of cell signaling receptors, <strong>cell-surface receptors</strong> and <strong>intracellular receptors</strong>, which work differently.</p>
<p>Signals impact on effector proteins to alter <u>metabolism, change cell shape or movement or alter gene expression</u>.</p>

<p>The same signals can trigger different effects, depending on the cell type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There Are Three Major Classes of Cell-Surface Receptor Proteins</p>
<p>These cell-surface receptors act as <strong>signal transducers</strong> by <u>converting an extracellular ligand-binding event into intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the target cell.</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ion-channel-coupled receptors</strong>, also known as <strong>transmitter-gated ion channels</strong> or <strong>ionotropic receptors</strong>, are involved in <strong>rapid synaptic signaling</strong> between nerve cells and other electrically excitable target cells such as nerve and muscle cells</li>
<li><strong>G-protein-coupled receptors</strong> act by <strong>indirectly regulating</strong> the activity of a <strong>separate plasma-membrane-bound target protein</strong>, which is generally either an enzyme or an ion channel. A <strong>trimeric GTP-binding protein</strong> (G protein) mediates the interaction between the <strong>activated receptor</strong> and this <strong>target protein</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enzyme-coupled receptors</strong> either function as enzymes or associate directly with enzymes that they activate (Figure 15–6C). They are usually <strong>single-pass</strong> transmembrane proteins that have their <strong>ligand-binding site</strong> outside the cell and their catalytic or enzyme-binding site inside</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There are also some types of cell-surface receptors that <u>do not fit easily into any of these classes</u> but have important functions in controlling the <strong>specialization</strong> of different cell types <u>during development</u> and in <strong>tissue renewal</strong> and <strong>repair</strong> in adults</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Signal processing</strong> can convert a simple signal into a complex response.
<ul>
<li>In many systems, for example, a gradual increase in an extracellular signal is converted into an <strong>abrupt, switch-like response</strong>.</li>
<li>In other cases, a simple input signal is converted into an <strong>oscillatory response</strong>, produced by a repeating series of transient intracellular signals.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> usually lies at the heart of <u>biochemical switches and oscillators</u>, as we describe later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> allows a response to be governed by multiple inputs. As discussed earlier, for example, <u>specific combinations of extracellular signals</u> are generally required to stimulate complex cell behaviors such as cell survival and proliferation (see Figure 15–4). The cell therefore has to <u>integrate information coming from multiple signals</u>, which often depends on intracellular <strong>coincidence detectors</strong>; these proteins are equivalent to <strong>AND gates</strong> in the microprocessor of a computer, in that they are only activated if they receive multiple converging signals</li>
<li><strong>Coordination</strong> of multiple responses in one cell can be achieved by a single extracellular signal. Some extracellular signal molecules, for example, stimulate a cell to both grow and divide. This coordination generally depends on <u>mechanisms for distributing a signal to multiple effectors, by creating branches</u> in the signaling pathway.
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the branching of signaling pathways can allow one signal to modulate the strength of a response to other signals</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Cell surface receptors rely on intracellular signaling proteins to relay the signal!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cell-Surface Receptors Relay Signals Via Intracellular Signaling Molecules</p>
<p><u>Some intracellular signaling molecules are small chemicals, which are often called <strong>second messengers</strong> (the “first messengers” being the extracellular signals). They are generated in large amounts in response to receptor activation and diffuse away from their source, spreading the signal to other parts of the cell</u>.</p>
<p>Some, such as <font color="EE0000"><strong>cyclic AMP</strong></font> and <font color="EE0000"><strong>Ca2+</strong></font>, are <strong>water-soluble</strong> and diffuse in the cytosol, while others, such as diacylglycerol, are lipid-soluble and diffuse in the plane of the plasma membrane. In either case, they pass the signal on by <u>binding to and altering the behavior of selected signaling or effector proteins.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Many of these proteins behave like <strong>molecular switches</strong>. When they receive a signal, they switch from an inactive to an active state, until another process switches them off, returning them to their inactive state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many intracellular signal molecules have active and inactive states</p>
<p>The switch between forms is due to</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein phosphorylation (Kinases (serine/threonine or tyrosine) attach phosphate, phosphatases dethatch phosphate)</li>
<li>GTP-binding</li>
<li>cAMP or Ca2+ binding</li>
<li>Ubiquitination, etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Intracellular Signals Must Be Specific and Precise in a Noisy Cytoplasm</p>
<ul>
<li>The binding of a signaling molecule to the correct target is determined by <strong>precise and complex interactions</strong> between <strong>complementary surfaces</strong> on the two molecules</li>
<li>Another important way that cells avoid responses to unwanted background signals depends on the ability of many downstream target proteins to <u>simply ignore such signals</u>. These proteins respond only when the upstream signal reaches a <strong>high concentration or activity level</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In these and other ways, intracellular signaling systems <u>filter out noise</u>, generating little or no response to low levels of stimuli</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><u>The largest class of molecular switches consists of proteins that are activated or inactivated by <strong>phosphorylation</strong></u> (discussed in Chapter 3). For these proteins, the switch is thrown in one direction by a <strong>protein kinase</strong>, which <u>covalently adds one or more phosphate groups to specific amino acids</u> on the signaling protein, and in the other direction by a <strong>protein phosphatase</strong>, which removes the phosphate groups</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <strong>two main types</strong> of protein kinase.
<ol type="1">
<li>The great majority are <strong>serine/threonine kinases</strong>, which phosphorylate the <u>hydroxyl groups (-OH) of serines and threonines</u> in their targets.</li>
<li>Others are <strong>tyrosine kinases</strong>, which phosphorylate proteins on tyrosines</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The other important class of molecular switches consists of <u><strong>GTP-binding proteins</strong> (discussed in Chapter 3). These proteins switch between an “on” (actively signaling) state when GTP is bound and an “off” state when GDP is bound. </u></p>
<p><u>In the “on” state, they usually have <strong>intrinsic GTPase activity</strong> and shut themselves off by hydrolyzing their bound GTP to GDP</u> (Figure 15–7B). There are two major types of GTP-binding proteins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Large, <strong>trimeric GTP-binding proteins</strong> (also called <strong>G proteins</strong>) help relay signals from G-protein-coupled receptors that activate them (see Figure 15–6B).</li>
<li>Small <strong>monomeric GTPases</strong> (also called <strong>monomeric GTP-binding proteins</strong> help relay signals from many classes of cell-surface receptors.</li>

<h3 id="characteristics-of-signal-transduction">7. Characteristics of signal transduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Relationship Between Signal and Response Varies in Different Signaling Pathways</p>
<p>The function of an intracellular signaling system is to <u>detect</u> and <u>measure</u> a specific stimulus in one location of a cell and then <u>generate</u> an appropriately <u>timed and measured response</u> at another location</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Response timing</strong> varies dramatically <u>in different signaling systems,</u> according to the <u>speed required for the response</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, such as synaptic signaling (see Figure 15–2C), the response can occur within milliseconds.<br />
</li>
<li>In other cases, as in the control of cell fate by morphogens during development, a full response can require hours or days.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitivity</strong> to extracellular signals can vary greatly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hormones</strong> tend to act at <u>very low concentrations</u> on their distant target cells, which are therefore highly sensitive to low concentrations of signal.</li>
<li><strong>Neurotransmitters</strong>, on the other hand, operate at <u>much higher concentrations at a synapse</u>, reducing the need for high sensitivity in postsynaptic receptors.</li>
<li>Sensitivity is often controlled by changes in the <strong>number</strong> or <strong>affinity</strong> of the receptors on the target cell. A particularly important mechanism for <u>increasing the sensitivity of a signaling system is signal <strong>amplification</strong>,</u> whereby a small number of activated cell-surface receptors evoke a large intracellular response either by producing large amounts of a second messenger or by activating many copies of a downstream signaling protein.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic range</strong> of a signaling system is <u>related to its sensitivity</u>. Some systems, like those involved in simple developmental decisions, are responsive over a narrow range of extracellular signal concentrations. Other systems, like those controlling vision or the metabolic response to some hormones, are highly responsive over a much broader range of signal strengths. We will see that broad dynamic range is often achieved by <strong>adaptation mechanisms</strong> that adjust the responsiveness of the system according to the prevailing amount of signal.</p>
<hr /></li>
<li><p><strong>Persistence</strong> of a response can vary greatly. A transient response of less than a second is appropriate in some synaptic responses, for example, while a prolonged or even permanent response is required in cell fate decisions during development.</p>
<p><u>Numerous mechanisms, including positive feedback, can be used to alter the duration and reversibility of a response.</u></p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Signal processing</strong> can convert a simple signal into a complex response.</u> In many systems, for example, a gradual increase in an extracellular signal is converted into an abrupt, switch-like response. In other cases, a simple input signal is converted into an oscillatory response, produced by a repeating series of transient intracellular signals. Feedback usually lies at the heart of biochemical switches and oscillators, as we describe later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration</strong> allows a response to be governed by multiple inputs. As discussed earlier, for example, specific combinations of extracellular signals are generally required to stimulate complex cell behaviors such as cell survival and proliferation (see Figure 15–4). <u>The cell therefore has to integrate information coming from multiple signals, which often depends on <strong>intracellular coincidence detectors</strong>;</u> these proteins are equivalent to AND gates in the microprocessor of a computer, in that they are only activated if they receive multiple converging signals</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Coordination</strong> of multiple responses in one cell can be achieved by a single extracellular signal.</u> Some extracellular signal molecules, for example, stimulate a cell to both grow and divide. This <u>coordination generally depends on mechanisms for distributing a signal to multiple effectors, by creating branches in the signaling pathway.</u> In some cases, the branching of signaling pathways can allow one signal to modulate the strength of a response to other signals.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>The Speed of a Response Depends on the Turnover of Signaling Molecules</p>
<p>The <strong>speed</strong> of any signaling response depends on the nature of the intracellular signaling molecules that <u>carry out the target cell's response</u>. When the response requires <u>only changes in proteins already present in the cell,</u> it can occur very rapidly</p>
<p>When the response involves changes in <strong>gene expression</strong> and the <u>synthesis of new proteins</u>, however, it usually requires many minutes or hours, regardless of the mode of signal delivery</p>

<p><strong>Fast response</strong>: alter protein function</p>
<ul>
<li>Alteration of <u>protein function</u> (i.e. activation/inactivation/modification) is immediate (i.e. seconds or less) upon signal reception, leading to fast responses.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Slow response</strong>: through transcription/translation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cells Can Respond Abruptly to a Gradually Increasing Signal</p>
<p><u>Some signaling systems are capable of generating a <strong>smoothly graded response</strong> over a wide range of extracellular signal concentrations</u> (Figure 15–15, blue line); such systems are useful, for example, in the <u>fine tuning of metabolic processes</u> by some hormones. <u>Other signaling systems generate significant responses only when the signal concentration rises <strong>beyond some threshold value</strong>.</u> These abrupt responses are of two types.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One is a <strong>sigmoidal response</strong>, in which <u>low concentrations of stimulus do not have much effect</u>, but then the response <u>rises steeply</u> and continuously at intermediate stimulus levels (Figure 15–15, red line). Such systems provide a <strong>filter</strong> to reduce inappropriate responses to low-level background <strong>signals</strong> but respond with high sensitivity when the stimulus falls within a small range of physiological signal concentrations.</li>
<li>A second type of abrupt response is the <strong>discontinuous</strong> or <strong>all-or-none response</strong>, in which the response switches on completely (and often irreversibly) when the signal reaches some <strong>threshold concentration</strong> (Figure 15–15, green line). Such responses are particularly useful for controlling the choice <u>between two alternative cell states</u>, and they generally involve <strong>positive feedback,</strong> as we describe in more detail shortly.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A similar sharpening of response is seen when the activation of an intracellular signaling protein requires <u>phosphorylation at more than one site</u>.

<p>The basal activity of the I phosphatase dephosphorylates (deactivates) the activated E kinase at a steady, low rate.</p>
<p>With a short delay, the system shows a strong, brief response when the signal is abruptly changed, and the feedback then drives the response back down to a lower level.</p>

<p>A <strong>delayed negative feedback</strong> with a <strong>long enough delay</strong> can produce responses that oscillate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cells Can Adjust Their Sensitivity to a Signal</p>
<p>The target cells accomplish this through a reversible process of <strong>adaptation</strong>, or <strong>desensitization</strong>, whereby a prolonged exposure to a stimulus <strong>decreases</strong> the cells' response to that level of stimulus. In chemical signaling, adaptation enables cells to <u>respond to changes in the concentration</u> of an extracellular signal molecule (rather than to the absolute concentration of the signal) over a very wide range of signal concentrations.</p>
<p><strong>Receptors</strong> can also become <strong>inactivated</strong> on the cell surface—for example, by becoming <strong>phosphorylated</strong>—with a short delay following their activation. Adaptation can also occur at sites <u>downstream of the receptors</u>, either by a change in <strong>intracellular signaling proteins</strong> involved in transducing the extracellular signal or by the <u>production of an inhibitor protein</u> that blocks the signal transduction process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trimeric G Proteins Relay Signals From GPCRs</p>
<p><font color ="EE0000"><strong>G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)</strong></font> form the largest family of cell-surface receptors, and they mediate most responses to signals from the external world, as well as signals from other cells, including <strong>hormones</strong>, <strong>neurotransmitters</strong>, and <strong>local mediators</strong></p>
<p><strong>All GPCRs have a similar structure</strong>. They consist of a single polypeptide chain that <u>threads back and forth across the lipid bilayer <strong>seven</strong> times</u>, forming a <strong>cylindrical structure</strong>, often with a deep ligand-binding site at its center (Figure 15–21). In addition to their characteristic orientation in the plasma membrane, they all use <strong>G proteins</strong> to relay the signal into the cell interior.</p>
<ul>
<li>G proteins are composed of three protein subunits—<strong>α, β, and γ.</strong> In the <strong>unstimulated state</strong>, the <strong>α subunit</strong> has <u>GDP bound</u> and the G protein is <strong>inactive</strong> (Figure 15–22).</li>
<li>When a GPCR is activated, it acts like a <strong>guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)</strong> and induces the <strong>α subunit</strong> to release its bound GDP, allowing GTP to bind in its place.</li>
<li>GTP binding then causes an activating conformational change in the Gα subunit, releasing the G protein from the receptor and triggering dissociation of the GTP-bound Gα subunit from the <strong>Gβγ pair</strong>—both of which then interact with various targets, such as <u>enzymes</u> and <u>ion channels</u> in the plasma membrane, which relay the signal onward</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)</strong>. RGS proteins act as α-subunit-specific GTPase-activating proteins (<strong>GAPs</strong>) (see Figure 15–8), and they help shut off G-protein-mediated responses in all eukaryotes.</p>

<p><font color="FF4500"><strong>Cyclic-AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase (PKA)</strong></font> Mediates Most of the Effects of Cyclic AMP</p>
<p>In most animal cells, cAMP exerts its effects mainly by activating <strong>cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)</strong>. This kinase phosphorylates specific <strong>serines</strong> or <strong>threonines</strong> on selected target proteins, including <strong>intracellular signaling proteins</strong> and <strong>effector proteins</strong>, thereby regulating their activity</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>inactive state</strong>, PKA consists of a complex of <strong>two catalytic subunits</strong> and <strong>two regulatory subunits.</strong> The binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits alters their conformation, causing them to <u>dissociate from the complex</u>. The released catalytic subunits are thereby activated to phosphorylate specific target proteins</li>
<li>The <strong>regulatory subunits</strong> of PKA (also called <font color="FF4500">A-kinase</font>) are important for localizing the kinase inside the cell: special <font color="FF4500"><strong>A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs)</strong></font> bind both to the regulatory subunits and to a component of the cytoskeleton or a membrane of an organelle, thereby <u>tethering the enzyme complex to a particular subcellular compartment</u>

<p>In cells that secrete the peptide hormone <strong>somatostatin</strong>, cAMP activates the gene that encodes this hormone.</p>

<p>Many GPCRs exert their effects through G proteins that activate the plasma-membrane-bound enzyme <font color="EE0000"><strong>phospholipase C-β (PLCβ)</strong></font></p>
<p>Receptors that activate this <strong>inositol phospholipid signaling pathway</strong> mainly do so via a <strong>G protein</strong> called <font color="EE0000">G<sub>q</sub> </font>, which <u>activates</u> phospholipase C-β in much the same way that <font color="EE0000">G<sub>s</sub> </font>activates adenylyl cyclase.</p>
<p>The activated <strong>phospholipase</strong> then cleaves the <font color="800000">PI(4,5)P2</font> to generate two products: <font color="EE0000">inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)</font> and <font color="EE0000"><strong>diacylglycerol</strong></font></p>
<ul>
<li>IP<sub>3</sub> is a <u>water-soluble</u> molecule that <u>leaves the plasma membrane</u> and diffuses rapidly through the <u>cytosol</u>.

<li>At the same time that the IP<sub>3</sub> produced by the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 is increasing the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol, the other cleavage product of the PI(4,5)P2, <strong>diacylglycerol</strong>, is exerting different effects. It also acts as a second messenger, but it remains <u>embedded in the plasma membrane</u>, where it has several potential signaling roles. One of its major functions is to activate a protein kinase called <font color="FF4500"><strong>protein kinase C (PKC)</strong></font>, so named because it is Ca2+-dependent
<ul>
<li><strong>Diacylglycerol</strong> can be further cleaved to release <font color="FF4500"><strong>arachidonic acid（花生四烯酸）</strong></font>, which can either act as a signal in its own right or be used in the synthesis of other small lipid signal molecules called <strong>eicosanoids（类花生酸）</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GPCR-mediated signals</strong> described earlier, act primarily through <strong>IP<sub>3</sub> receptors</strong> to stimulate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the ER</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smell and Vision Depend on GPCRs That Regulate Ion Channels</p>
<p>Humans can distinguish more than 10,000 distinct smells, which they detect using specialized olfactory receptor neurons in the lining of the nose. These cells use specific GPCRs called <strong>olfactory receptors</strong> to recognize odors; the receptors are displayed on the surface of the <strong>modified cilia</strong> that extend from each cell</p>
<ul>
<li>The receptors act through cAMP. When stimulated by odorant (有气味的东西) binding they activate an <font color="EE0000">olfactory-specific G protein</font> (known as <font color="EE0000">G<sub>olf</sub> </font>), which in turn activates <strong>adenylyl cyclase</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting increase in cAMP opens <strong>cyclic-AMP-gated cation channels</strong>, thereby allowing an influx of Na+, which depolarizes the olfactory receptor neuron and <u>initiates</u> a nerve impulse that travels along its axon to the brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each olfactory receptor neuron produces only one of these receptors;</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertebrate <strong>vision</strong> employs a similarly elaborate, highly sensitive, signal-detection process. Cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels are also involved, but the crucial cyclic nucleotide is <font color="EE0000">cyclic GMP (cGMP)</font> (Figure 15–37) rather than cAMP</p>

<p>Nitric Oxide Is a Gaseous Signaling Mediator That Passes Between Cells</p>
<p>In mammals, one of NO's many functions is to <u>relax smooth muscle</u> in the walls of blood vessels.</p>
<p>The activated receptor triggers <font color="EE0000">IP<sub>3</sub> </font> synthesis and <font color="EE0000">Ca2+</font> release (see Figure 15–29), leading to stimulation of an enzyme that synthesizes NO</p>
<ul>
<li>dissolved NO <u>passes readily across membranes,</u> it diffuses out of the cell where it is produced and into neighboring smooth muscle cells, where it causes <u>muscle relaxation</u> and thereby <u>vessel dilation</u></li>
</ul>
<p>NO is made by the deamination of the amino acid <strong>arginine</strong>, catalyzed by enzymes called <strong>NO synthases (NOS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NOS in endothelial cells is called <strong>eNOS</strong>, while that in nerve and muscle cells is called <strong>nNOS</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Both eNOS and nNOS are stimulated by <strong>Ca2+</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Macrophages, by contrast, make yet another NOS, called inducible NOS (<strong>iNOS</strong>), that is constitutively active but synthesized only when the cells are activated, usually in response to an infection.</li>

<p>The neurotransmitter <strong>acetylcholine</strong> activates a GPCR which in turn activates NO synthase in endothelial cell (eNOS) to produce NO.</p>
<p>NO diffuses into smooth muscle cell and activates guanylyl cyclase to produce cyclic GMP (cGMP), which triggers muscle relaxation and thus the dilation of the blood vessel</p>

<h1 id="五gpcr-desensitization">五、GPCR desensitization</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>GPCR Desensitization Depends on Receptor <strong>Phosphorylation</strong></p>
<p>when target cells are exposed to a high concentration of a stimulating ligand for a prolonged period, they can become <strong>desensitized</strong>, or <strong>adapted</strong></p>
<p>For GPCRs, there are three general modes of adaptation (see Figure 15–20):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <strong>receptor sequestration (受体隔离)</strong>, they are temporarily <u>moved to the interior of the cell</u> (internalized) so that they no longer have access to their ligand.</li>
<li>In <strong>receptor down-regulation (受体下调)</strong>, they are <u>destroyed in lysosomes</u> after internalization.</li>
<li>In <strong>receptor inactivation (受体去活)</strong>, they become altered so that they can no longer interact with G proteins</li>
</ol>
<p>In each case, the desensitization of the GPCRs depends on their <strong>phosphorylation</strong> by <font color="EE0000">PKA</font>, <font color="EE0000">PKC</font>, or a member of the family of <font color="EE0000">GPCR kinases (GRKs)</font></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>GRKs</strong> phosphorylate multiple <u>serines and threonines</u> on a GPCR, but they do so only <u>after ligand binding</u> has activated the receptor, because it is the <u>activated receptor that allosterically activates the GRK.</u></li>
<li>As with rhodopsin, once a receptor has been phosphorylated by a GRK, it binds with high affinity to a member of the <font color="EE0000"><strong>arrestin</strong></font> family of proteins. The bound <strong>arrestin</strong> can contribute to the desensitization process in at least two ways.
<ol type="1">
<li>First, it prevents the <u>activated receptor</u> from interacting with G proteins (<strong>receptor inactivation</strong>).</li>
<li>Second, it serves as an <strong>adaptor protein</strong> to help couple the receptor to the <strong>clathrin-dependent endocytosis machinery</strong> (discussed in Chapter 13), inducing receptor-mediated endocytosis.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Four strategies to terminate/desensitize the GPCR signaling: 1. <strong>Down-regulation of Receptor</strong> + Receptor sequestration (endocytosis) + Receptor elimination + GPCRs are phosphorylated by GPCR kinases, triggering arrestin binding, uncoupling receptors from G proteins and promotes their endocytosis. + Receptor deactivation</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Deactivation of G protein:</strong>
<ul>
<li>G-protein <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-subunit is stimulated by its target protein or RGS to hydrolyse GTP into GDP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Elimination of second messenger</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>IP<sub>3</sub> is dephosphorylated by lipid phosphatase or phosphorylated by lipase kinase.</li>
<li>cAMP/cGMP is hydrolyzed by activated phosphodiesterases.</li>

<h2 id="origin-of-internal-membrane-and-membrane-bound-organelles">Origin of internal membrane and membrane-bound organelles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The precursors of the first eukaryotic cells are thought to have been relatively simple cells that—like <u>most bacterial and archaeal cells—have a plasma membrane but no internal membranes</u>. The plasma membrane in such cells provides all membrane-dependent functions, including the <u>pumping of ions, ATP synthesis, protein secretion, and lipid synthesis.</u></p>
<p>A hypothetical scheme for how the first eukaryotic cells, with a nucleus and ER, might have evolved by the invagination and pinching off of the plasma membrane of an ancestral cell is illustrated in Figure 12–3.This process would create membrane-enclosed organelles with an interior or <strong>lumen</strong> that is <strong>topologically equivalent</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compartments are said to be <strong>topologically equivalent</strong> if they can <u>communicate with one another</u></p></li>
<li><p>We shall see that this topological relationship holds for all of the organelles involved in the secretory and endocytic pathways, including the <strong>ER</strong>, <strong>Golgi apparatus</strong>, <strong>endosomes</strong>, <strong>lysosomes</strong>, and <strong>peroxisomes</strong>. We can therefore think of all of these organelles as members of the <strong>same topologically equivalent compartment</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Because this double membrane of nucleus is penetrated by nuclear pore complexes, the <strong>nuclear compartment</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>cytosol</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, the lumen of the <strong>ER</strong> is continuous with the space between the inner and outer nuclear membranes, and it is topologically equivalent to the <strong>extracellular space</strong></p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>In <strong>gated transport</strong>, proteins and RNA molecules move between the cytosol and the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear envelope.</p>
<p>The nuclear pore complexes function as <strong>selective gates</strong> that support the active transport of specific macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies between the two topologically equivalent spaces, although they also allow <u>free diffusion</u> of smaller molecules.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Protein translocation</strong> (unfolded protein “snake” through transmembrane translocators) <span class="math inline">\(\rarr\)</span> signal peptides, sorting signals/motifs (Lecture 9 and 10)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In protein translocation, <strong>transmembrane protein translocators</strong> directly transport specific proteins across a membrane from the cytosol into a space that is <strong>topologically distinct.</strong></p>
<p>The transported protein molecule usually must <strong>unfold</strong> to snake through the translocator. The initial transport of selected proteins from the cytosol into the ER lumen or mitochondria, for example, occurs in this way.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integral membrane proteins</strong> often use the same translocators but translocate only partially across the membrane, so that the protein becomes embedded in the lipid bilayer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Vesicular transport</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\rarr\)</span>sorting signals/motifs (Lecture 11)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In vesicular transport, membrane-enclosed transport intermediates— which may be small, spherical transport vesicles or larger, irregularly shaped organelle fragments—ferry proteins <strong>from one topologically equivalent compartment to another</strong>.</p>
<p>The transport vesicles and fragments become loaded with a cargo of molecules derived from the lumen of one compartment as they bud and pinch off from its membrane; they discharge their cargo into a second compartment by fusing with the membrane enclosing that compartment (Figure 12–6).</p>
<ul>
<li>The transfer of soluble proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, for example, occurs in this way. Because the transported proteins do not cross a membrane, <u>vesicular transport can move proteins only between compartments that are <strong>topologically equivalent</strong></u></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>Principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cargo recognition depends on sorting signals (signal sequences).</li>
<li>Cargo transportation requires transport machinery.</li>
<li><u>Protein without any kind of sorting signal remain in the cytosol.</u></li>

<p><u>Such signal sequences are often found at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain</u>, and in many cases specialized <strong>signal peptidases</strong> remove the signal sequence from the finished protein once the sorting process is complete</p>
<p>Signal sequences can also be internal stretches of amino acids, which remain part of the protein.</p>

<h4 id="role-of-gtpase">Role of GTPase</h4>
<p>Nuclear import/export consume energy, which is controlled by Ran GTPase (nuclear transport cycle)</p>
<p>The “GTPase cycle” of RAN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ran-GDP (cytosol)</li>
<li>Ran-GTP (nucleus)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A cytosolic <strong>GTPase-activating protein (GAP)</strong> triggers GTP hydrolysis and thus converts Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP,</p>
<p>A nuclear <strong>guanine exchange factor (GEF)</strong> promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP and thus converts Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP.</p>
<p>Because Ran-GAP is located in the cytosol and Ran-GEF is located in the nucleus where it is anchored to chromatin, the cytosol contains mainly Ran-GDP, and the nucleus contains mainly Ran-GTP</p>
<p>This gradient of the two conformational forms of Ran drives nuclear transport in the appropriate direction</p>
<ul>
<li>This occurs whether or not these receptors are loaded with appropriate cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the Ran-GDP in the cytosol does not bind to import (or export) receptors, unloading occurs only on the nuclear side of the NPC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transport occurs according to gradient cytosol/nucleus</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Cytosolic Ran-GDP is “activated” by a Ran-GEF (Guanine nucleotide exchange factor) in the nucleus. This converts Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP</li>
<li>In the cytosol, Ran-GTP is stimulated by Ran-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) to hydrolyse its GTP (conversion to Ran-GDP)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to its crucial role in nuclear transport, the Ran GTPase also acts as a positional marker for chromatin during cell division, when the nuclear and cytosolic components intermix.</p>
<p><u>Because Ran-GEF remains bound to <strong>chromatin</strong> when the nuclear envelope breaks down, Ran molecules close to chromatin are mainly in their GTP-bound conformation</u></p>

<p>The control of nuclear import of the transcription factor NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) during T cell activation is due to altered Ca2+ levels:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Peroxisomes detoxify chemicals, metabolize fatty acids and synthesize key lipid</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peroxisomes are so named because they usually contain one or more enzymes that use <strong>molecular oxygen</strong> to remove <strong>hydrogen atoms</strong> from specific organic substrates (designated here as R) in an oxidation reaction that produces <strong>hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(RH_2 + O_2 → R + H_2O_2\)</span></p>

<p>A major function of the oxidation reactions performed in peroxisomes is the breakdown of fatty acid molecules. The process, called <strong>β oxidation</strong></p>

<p>Membrane trafficking is the process by which proteins, pathogens, and other macromolecules are distributed throughout the cell, and released to or internalised from the extracellular space.</p>
<p>Membrane trafficking uses membrane-bound vesicles as transport intermediaries.</p>
<p>This transport can take place within different organelles in the same cell, or across the cell membrane to and from the extracellular environment.</p>
<p><strong>Membrane trafficking mediates the biosynthetic-secretory and endocytic pathways</strong>：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vesicular traffic flows along highly organized, directional routes, which allow the cell to <u>secrete, eat, and remodel its plasma membrane and organelles.</u></p>

<h4 id="the-three-major-transport-vesicles-mediate-transport">The three major transport vesicles mediate transport</h4>

<p>There are three well-characterized types of coated vesicles, distinguished by their major coat proteins: <strong>clathrin-coated,</strong> <strong>COPI-coated</strong>, and <strong>COPII-coated</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clathrin: transport proteins from the plasma membrane (endocytosis) and anterograde from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to early and late endosomes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both cis and trans faces are closely associated with special compartments, each composed of a network of <u>interconnected tubular and cisternal structures</u>: the <strong>cis Golgi network (CGN)</strong> and the <strong>trans Golgi network (TGN)</strong>, respectively</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clathrin-coated vesicles</strong>, for example, mediate transport <u>from the Golgi apparatus and from the plasma membrane</u>, whereas <strong>COPI and COPII-coated</strong> vesicles most commonly mediate transport <u>from the ER and from the Golgi cisternae</u></p>

<h5 id="clathrin-coated-vesicle-ccv">(2) Clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>The major protein component of clathrin-coated vesicles is <strong>clathrin (网格蛋白)</strong> itself, which forms the outer layer of the coat. Each clathrin subunit consists of <u>three large and three small polypeptide chains</u> that together form a <u>three-legged structure called a <strong>triskelion</strong></u></p>
<p>Clathrin triskelions assemble into a basketlike framework of hexagons and pentagons to form coated pits (buds) on the cytosolic surface of membranes (Figure 13–7). Under appropriate conditions, isolated triskelions spontaneously self-assemble into typical polyhedral cages in a test tube, even in the absence of the membrane vesicles that these baskets normally enclose (Figure 13–6C,D). Thus, the clathrin triskelions determine the geometry of the clathrin cage (Figure 13–6E).</p>

<p>“Clathrin” consists of 3 large and 3 small polypeptide chains, which assemble into a “three-legged” triskelion</p>

<p><strong>Adaptor proteins</strong>, another major coat component in clathrin-coated vesicles, form a discrete inner layer of the coat, <u>positioned between the clathrin cage and the membrane</u></p>
<p>They <u>bind the clathrin coat to the membrane</u> and <u>trap various transmembrane proteins</u>, including transmembrane receptors that capture soluble cargo molecules inside the vesicle—so-called <strong>cargo receptors.</strong></p>
<p>In this way, the adaptor proteins select a specific set of transmembrane proteins, together with the soluble proteins that interact with them,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each type of adaptor protein is specific for a different set of cargo receptors. Clathrin-coated vesicles budding <u>from different membranes</u> use <u>different adaptor proteins</u> and thus package different receptors and cargo molecules</p>

<h4 id="ap-complexes-bind-to-phospholipids-and-to-cargo-protein">AP complexes bind to phospholipids and to cargo protein</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The adaptor protein <strong>AP2</strong> serves as a well-understood example</p>
<p>When it binds to a specific <u>phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipid (a phosphoinositide),</u> it <u>alters its conformation</u>, <u>exposing binding sites for cargo receptors in the membrane</u>. The simultaneous binding to the cargo receptors and lipid head groups greatly <u>enhances the binding of <strong>AP2</strong> to the membrane</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Because several requirements must be met simultaneously to stably bind AP2 proteins to a membrane, the proteins act as <strong>coincidence detectors</strong> that only assemble at the right time and place</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon binding, they <strong>induce membrane curvature</strong>, which makes the binding of additional AP2 proteins in its proximity more likely. The <strong>cooperative assembly</strong> of the AP2 coat layer then is further <u>amplified by clathrin binding</u>, which leads to the formation and budding of a transport vesicle</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptor proteins found in other coats also bind to <strong>phosphoinositides</strong> which not only have a major role in directing when and where coats assemble in the cell, but also are used much more widely as <u>molecular markers</u> of <u>compartment identity</u>. This helps to control vesicular traffic,</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a clathrin-coated bud grows, soluble cytoplasmic proteins, including <strong>dynamin</strong>, assemble at the <strong>neck of each bud</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dynamin</strong> contains a <strong>PI(4,5)</strong> <strong>P<sub>2</sub>-binding domain</strong>, which tethers the protein to the membrane, and a <strong>GTPase domain</strong>, which regulates the <strong>rate</strong> at which vesicles <u>pinch off from the membrane.</u></p>
<p>The pinching-off process brings the two noncytosolic leaflets of the membrane into <u>close proximity</u> and <u>fuses</u> them, sealing off the forming vesicle</p>
<ul>
<li>To perform this task, <strong>dynamin</strong> <u>recruits other proteins to the neck of the bud</u>. Together with <strong>dynamin</strong>, they help <u>bend the patch of membrane</u>—by directly <u>distorting the bilayer structure</u>, or by <u>changing its lipid composition</u> through the recruitment of <u><strong>lipid-modifying enzymes</strong></u>, or by both mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once released from the membrane, the vesicle <u>rapidly loses its clathrin coat.</u> A <strong>PIP phosphatase</strong> that is <strong>co-packaged</strong> into clathrin-coated vesicles <u>depletes</u> <font color="DD0000"><strong>PI(4,5) P<sub>2</sub></strong></font> from the membrane, which <u>weakens the binding of the adaptor proteins</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, an <strong>hsp70</strong> chaperone protein (see Figure 6–80) functions as an <strong>uncoating ATPase</strong>, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to peel off（剥离） the clathrin coat.</li>

<p><strong>Coat-recruitment GTPases</strong>, for example, control the assembly of clathrin coats on endosomes and the COPI and COPII coats on Golgi and ER membranes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GTP-binding proteins regulate most processes <u>in eukaryotic cells</u>. They act as <strong>molecular switches</strong>, which <u>flip between an active state with GTP bound and an inactive state with GDP bound</u></p>
<p>Two classes of proteins regulate the flipping: <strong>guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)</strong> activate the proteins by <u>catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP,</u> and <strong>GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)</strong> inactivate the proteins by <u>triggering the hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP</u></p>
<p>Both monomeric GTP-binding proteins (<strong>monomeric GTPases</strong>) and <strong>trimeric</strong> GTP-binding proteins (<strong>G proteins</strong>) have important roles in vesicle transport</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Coat-recruitment GTPases</strong> are members of a family of <strong>monomeric GTPases</strong>. They include the <font color="EE0000"><strong>ARF proteins</strong></font>, which are responsible for the assembly of both <strong>COPI and clathrin coats</strong> assembly at Golgi membranes, and the <font color="EE0000"><strong>Sar1 protein</strong></font>, which is responsible for the assembly of <strong>COPII coats at the ER membrane</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When a COPII-coated vesicle is to bud from the ER membrane, for example, a specific <font color="EE0000"><strong>Sar1-GEF</strong></font> embedded in the ER membrane binds to <font color="EE0000"><strong>cytosolic Sar1</strong></font>, causing the Sar1 to release its GDP and bind GTP in its place</p></li>
<li><p>GTP is present in much higher concentration in the cytosol than GDP and therefore will spontaneously bind after GDP is released.) In its GTP-bound state, the <strong>Sar1 protein</strong> <u>exposes an <strong>amphiphilic helix</strong></u>, which inserts into the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the ER membrane. The tightly bound <strong>Sar1</strong> now <u>recruits adaptor coat protein subunits</u> to the ER membrane to initiate budding</p></li>
</ul>
<p><u>The coat-recruitment GTPases also have a role in <strong>coat disassembly</strong>.</u> The hydrolysis of bound <u>GTP to GDP causes the GTPase to change its conformation</u> so that its hydrophobic <u>tail <strong>pops out of the membrane</strong></u>, causing the vesicle’s coat to disassemble. Although it is not known what triggers the GTP hydrolysis, it has been proposed that the <u>GTPases work like timers</u></p>
<ul>
<li>COPII coats accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Sar1, and a fully formed vesicle will be produced only when bud formation occurs <u>faster</u> than the timed disassembly process;</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a vesicle pinches off, GTP hydrolysis releases Sar1, but the sealed coat is sufficiently stabilized through many <strong>cooperative interactions</strong>, including <u>binding to the cargo receptors in the membrane</u>, that it may stay on the vesicle <u>until the vesicle docks at a target membrane</u>. There, a <strong>kinase phosphorylates</strong> the coat proteins, which completes coat disassembly and readies the vesicle for fusion</p>
<p><strong>Clathrin- and COPI-coated vesicles</strong>, by contrast, shed their coat soon <u>after they pinch off.</u> For COPI vesicles, the <strong>curvature</strong> of the vesicle membrane serves as a trigger to <u>begin uncoating</u>. An <font color="EE0000"><strong>ARF-GAP</strong></font> is recruited to the COPI coat as it assembles. It interacts with the membrane, and <u>senses</u> the <strong>lipid packing density</strong>. It becomes activated when the curvature of the membrane approaches that of a transport vesicle. It then inactivates ARF, causing the coat to disassemble</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Collagen</strong>, for example, is assembled in the ER as <u>300-nm-long</u>, stiff procollagen rods that then are secreted from the cell where they are cleaved by proteases to collagen, which is embedded into the extracellular matrix</li>
<li><strong>Procollagen</strong> rods do not fit into the <u>60–80 nm COPII vesicles</u> normally observed. To circumvent this problem, the procollagen cargo molecules bind to transmembrane <strong>packaging proteins</strong> in the ER, which control the assembly of the COPII coat components</li>

<p>Like the coat-recruitment GTPases, Rab proteins <u><strong>cycle between</strong> a membrane \and the cytosol</u> and <u>regulate the reversible assembly of protein complexes on the membrane</u>.

<p>Membrane-bound <strong>Rab-GEFs</strong> <u>activate Rab proteins on both transport vesicle and target membranes</u>; for some membrane fusion events, activated Rab molecules are required on both sides of the reaction. Once in the <strong>GTP-bound state</strong> and membrane-bound through a <strong>now-exposed lipid anchor</strong>, Rab proteins bind to other proteins, called <font color="EE0000">Rab effectors</font>, which are the downstream mediators of <u>vesicle transport</u>, <u>membrane tethering,</u> and <u>membrane fusion</u> (Figure 13–16).</p>
<p>The <strong>rate of GTP hydrolysis</strong> sets the <u>concentration of active Rab</u> and, consequently, the <u>concentration of its effectors on the membrane</u></p>
<p>The same Rab proteins can often bind to many different effectors. Some Rab effectors are <strong>motor proteins</strong> that propel vesicles along <strong>actin filaments</strong> or <strong>microtubules</strong> to their target membrane.

<p>A <strong>Rab5</strong> domain concentrates tethering proteins that catch incoming vesicles.

<h3 id="autophagy">2. Autophagy</h3>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>All cell types dispose of obsolete parts by a lysosome-dependent process called <strong>autophagy</strong>, or “self-eating.”</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps restructure differentiating cells, but also in adaptive responses to stresses such as <strong>starvation</strong> and <strong>infection</strong>. Autophagy can remove large objects—<strong>macromolecules</strong>, large <strong>protein aggregates</strong>, and even <strong>whole organelles</strong>—that other disposal mechanisms such as <strong>proteasomal degradation</strong> cannot handle</li>
<li>In the initial stages of autophagy, cytoplasmic cargo becomes surrounded by a double membrane that assembles by the fusion of small vesicles of unknown origin, forming an <strong>autophagosome</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process occurs in the following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Induction by <u>activation of signaling molecules</u>: Protein kinases (including the <font color="EE0000"><strong>mTOR complex 1</strong></font>, discussed in Chapter 15) that <u>relay information about the metabolic status of the cell</u>, become <strong>activated</strong> and <u>signal to the autophagic machinery.</u></li>
<li>Nucleation and extension of a <u>delimiting</u> membrane into a crescent-shaped cup: Membrane vesicles, characterized by the presence of <font color="EE0000"><strong>ATG9</strong></font>, the only transmembrane protein involved in the process, are recruited to an <strong>assembly site</strong>, where they <u>nucleate autophagosome formation</u>.
<ul>
<li><strong>ATG9</strong> is <u>not incorporated into the autophagosome</u>: a <strong>retrieval pathway</strong> must remove it from the assembling structure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Closure</strong> of the membrane cup around the target to form a <strong>sealed double-membrane-enclosed autophagosome</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fusion</strong> of the autophagosome with lysosomes, catalyzed by <font color="EE0000"><strong>SNAREs</strong></font>.</li>
<li><strong>Digestion</strong> of the inner membrane and the lumenal contents of the <strong>autophagosome</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="selective-nonselective">Selective / Nonselective</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Autophagy can be either nonselective or selective</p>
<p>In <strong>nonselective autophagy</strong>, a bulk portion of cytoplasm is sequestered in autophagosomes. It might occur, for example, in <strong>starvation conditions</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>selective autophagy</strong> specific cargo is packaged into autophagosomes that tend to contain little cytosol, and their shape reflects the shape of the cargo. Selective autophagy mediates the degradation of worn out, or otherwise unwanted, mitochondria, peroxisomes, ribosomes, and ER; it can also be used to destroy invading microbes</p>
<ul>
<li>The selective autophagy of worn out or damaged <strong>mitochondria</strong> is called <strong>mitophagy</strong>
<ul>
<li>Damaged mitochondria <u>cannot maintain the gradient</u>, so <u>protein import is blocked</u>. As a consequence, a protein kinase called <font color="EE0000"><strong>Pink1</strong></font>, which is normally imported into mitochondria, is instead retained on the mitochondrial surface where it recruits the ubiquitin ligase <font color="EE0000"><strong>Parkin</strong></font> from the cytosol
<ul>
<li>Mutations in <strong>Pink1</strong> or <strong>Parkin</strong> cause a form of early-onset <strong>Parkinson’s disease,</strong></li>

<blockquote>
<p>In endocytosis, the material to be ingested is progressively enclosed by a small portion of the plasma membrane, which first <strong>invaginates</strong> and then pinches off to form an <strong>endocytic vesicle</strong> containing the ingested substance or particle</p>
<ul>
<li>Most eukaryotic cells <u>constantly form endocytic vesicles</u>, a process called <strong>pinocytosis</strong> (“cell drinking”); in addition</li>
<li>some specialized cells contain dedicated pathways that <u>take up large particles on demand</u>, a process called <strong>phagocytosis</strong> (“cell eating”).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Specialized Phagocytic Cells Can Ingest Large Particles</p>
<p><strong>Phagocytosis</strong> is a special form of endocytosis in which a cell uses large endocytic vesicles called <strong>phagosomes</strong> to ingest large particles such as microorganisms and dead cells. Phagocytosis is <u>distinct, both in purpose and mechanism</u>, from <strong>macropinocytosis</strong></p>
<p>Phagocytosis is important in most animals for purposes other than nutrition, and it is carried out mainly by specialized cells—so-called <strong>professional phagocytes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In mammals, two important classes of white blood cells that act as professional phagocytes are <strong>macrophages</strong> and <strong>neutrophils</strong>
<ul>
<li>These cells develop from hemopoietic stem cells and they ingest invading microorganisms to defend us against infection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Macrophages</strong> also have an important role in scavenging senescent (变老的) cells and cells that have died by apoptosiss</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Pinocytic Vesicles Form from Coated Pits in the Plasma Membrane</p>
<p><strong>Pinocytosis</strong> varies between cell types, but it is usually surprisingly high</p>
<ul>
<li>Since a cell's surface area and volume remain unchanged during this process, it is clear that the same amount of membrane being removed by endocytosis is being added to the cell surface by the converse process of <strong>exocytosis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The endocytic part of the cycle often begins at <strong>clathrin-coated pits</strong>. These specialized regions typically occupy about 2% of the total plasma membrane area</p>
<ul>
<li>The lifetime of a clathrin-coated pit is short: within a minute or so of being formed, it invaginates into the cell and pinches off to form a <strong>clathrin-coated vesicle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Not All Pinocytic Vesicles Are Clathrin-Coated</p>
<p>In addition to clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, cells can form other types of pinocytic vesicles, such as <strong>caveolae</strong> (from the Latin for “little cavities”), originally recognized by their ability to transport molecules <u>across endothelial cells</u> that form the inner lining of blood vessels</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Caveolae</strong>, sometimes seen in the electron microscope as deeply invaginated flasks, are <u>present in the plasma membrane of most vertebrate cell types</u></p></li>
<li><p>They are thought to form from <strong>lipid rafts</strong> in the plasma membrane, which are rich in in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major structural proteins in caveolae are <strong>caveolins</strong>, a family of unusual integral membrane proteins that each insert a hydrophobic loop into the membrane from the cytosolic side but <u>do not extend across the membrane</u></p>
<p>On their cytosolic side, caveolins are bound to large protein complexes of caving proteins, which are thought to stabilize the membrane curvature.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>In contrast to clathrin-coated and COPI or COPII-coated vesicles, caveolae are usually static structures and they can be induced to pinch off and serve as endocytic vesicles to transport cargo to early endosomes or to the plasma membrane on the opposite side of a polarized cell (<strong>Transcytosis</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Some animal viruses such as <strong>SV40</strong> and <strong>papillomavirus</strong> (which causes warts) enter cells in vesicles derived from caveolae</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cholera</strong> toxin (discussed in Chapters 15 and 19) also enters the cell through caveolae and is transported to the ER before entering the cytosol</p></li>

<p>Clathrin-independent endocytosis</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Macropinocytosis is another clathrin-independent endocytic mechanism that can be activated in <u>practically all animal cells</u></p>
<p>In most cell types, it does not operate continually but rather is induced for a limited time in response to cell-surface receptor activation by specific cargoes, including <strong>growth factors</strong>, <strong>integrin ligands</strong>, <strong>apoptotic cell remnants</strong>, and some viruses</p>
<ul>
<li>These ligands <u>activate a complex signaling pathway</u>, resulting in a change in <u>actin dynamics</u> and the formation of cell-surface protrusions, called <strong>ruffles</strong>（皱纹、褶皱）</li>
<li>When <strong>ruffles</strong> collapse back onto the cell, large fluid-filled endocytic vesicles form, called <strong>macropinosomes</strong></li>

<ol type="1">
<li>The distribution of the molecule after its uptake reveals the sequence of events. Within a minute or so after adding the tracer, it starts to appear in <strong>early endosomes</strong>, just beneath the plasma membrane</li>
<li>By 5–15 minutes later, it has moved to <strong>late endosomes</strong>, close to the <strong>Golgi apparatus</strong> and near the nucleus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Early endosomes have tubular and vacuolar domains. Most of the membrane surface is in the <strong>tubules</strong> and most of the volume is in the vacuolar domain</p>
<ul>
<li>During endosome maturation, the two domains have different fates:
<ol type="1">
<li>the <strong>vacuolar portions</strong> of the early endosome are retained and transformed into late endosomes;</li>
<li>the <strong>tubular portions</strong> shrink</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maturing endosomes</strong>, also called <strong>multivesicular bodies</strong>, migrate along microtubules toward the cell interior, shedding membrane tubules and vesicles that recycle material to the plasma membrane and TGN, and receiving newly synthesized lysosomal proteins</p>
<p>As they concentrate in a perinuclear region of the cell, the multivesicular bodies fuse with each other, and eventually with endolysosomes and lysosomes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many changes occur during the maturation process</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The endosome <strong>changes shape and location</strong>, as the tubular domains are lost and the vacuolar domains are thoroughly modified</li>
<li><strong>Rab proteins</strong>, <strong>phosphoinositide lipids</strong>, <strong>fusion machinery</strong> (SNAREs and tethers), and <strong>microtubule motor proteins</strong> all participate in a molecular <strong>makeover</strong>（打扮、装饰） of the cytosolic face of the endosome membrane, changing the functional characteristics of the organelle</li>
<li>A <strong>V-type ATPase</strong> in the endosome membrane pumps H+ from the cytosol into the endosome lumen and <strong>acidifies</strong> the organelle.</li>
<li><strong>Intralumenal vesicles</strong> <strong>sequester</strong>（扣押） endocytosed signaling receptors inside the endosome, thus halting the receptor signaling activity.</li>
<li>Lysosome proteins are <strong>delivered</strong> <u>from the TGN to the maturing endosome.</u></li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these events occur gradually but eventually lead to a complete transformation of the endosome into an early endolysosome.</p>
<p>In addition to committing selected cargo for degradation, the maturation process is important for lysosome maintenances</p>

<p>Plasma Membrane Signaling Receptors are Down-Regulated by Degradation in Lysosomes</p>
<p>A second pathway that endocytosed receptors can follow from endosomes is taken by many signaling receptors, including <strong>opioid receptors</strong> and the receptor that binds <strong>epidermal growth factor (EGF)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike LDL receptors, EGF receptors accumulate in <strong>clathrin-coated pits</strong> only after binding their ligand, and most do not recycle but are <u>degraded in lysosomes</u>, along with the ingested EGF</li>
<li>This is a a process called <strong>receptor downregulation</strong>, that reduces the cell's subsequent sensitivity to EGF</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Receptor downregulation is highly regulated. The activated receptors are first covalently modified on the cytosolic face with the small protein <strong>ubiquitin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike <strong>polyubiquitylation</strong>, which adds a chain of ubiquitins that typically targets a protein for degradation in proteasomes, ubiquitin tagging for sorting into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway adds just <u>one or a few</u> single ubiquitin molecules to the protein—a process called <strong>monoubiquitylation</strong> or <strong>multiubiquitylation</strong>, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Ubiquitin-binding proteins</strong> recognize the attached ubiquitin and <u>help direct</u> the modified receptors into <strong>clathrin-coated pits</strong></li>
<li>After delivery to the <strong>early endosome</strong>, other ubiquitin-binding proteins that are part of <font color="EE0000"><strong>ESCRT</strong> <strong>complexes</strong> (ESCRT = Endosome Sorting Complex Required for Transport)</font> recognize and sort the ubiquitylated receptors into intralumenal vesicles, which are retained in the maturing late endosome</li>

<p>In this way, <u>addition of ubiquitin <strong>blocks receptor recycling</strong> to the plasma membrane</u> and <strong><u>directs the receptors into the degradation pathways</u></strong></p>
