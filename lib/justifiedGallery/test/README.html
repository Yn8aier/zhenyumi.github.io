<p>This folder contains tests to ensure that JG works properly.</p>
<p>Making automatic tests to check that things are visually appealing is difficult.<br />
For now these tests only show specific configurations and can be check by an human.</p>
<p>To visualize them execute in the root folder:</p>
<p>http-serve</p>
<p>and open the single pages. For example:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8000/test/main/basic_test.html">http://localhost:8000/test/main/basic_test.html</a></p>
